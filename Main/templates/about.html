    <h2 class="pmx-title">01. Introduction – Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Price Marketplace</strong> is a digital platform designed to reduce the wide and frustrating price
      variations across food markets in Nigeria.
    </p>
      <ul class="pmx-list">
        <li><strong>Merchants</strong> can log in daily to update the prices of their food items.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumers</strong> can access the platform to see up-to-date prices and make better shopping decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Government agencies and research bodies</strong> can use the aggregated price data for monitoring, regulation, and policy development.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="pmx-muted">
      By promoting price transparency, the platform helps consumers save money, gives merchants visibility, and enables
      policymakers to work with reliable food price data.

  <!-- 03. Beyond Prices – Reducing Carbon Emissions -->
  <article class="pmx-section">
    <h2 class="pmx-title">03. Beyond Prices – Reducing Carbon Emissions</h2>

    <h3 class="pmx-subtitle">Background</h3>
    <p>
      Transportation is a leading source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide.
      <strong>Carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong> accounts for the largest share.
      <strong>Road transport</strong> contributes roughly <strong>76%</strong> of transport emissions.
      Over the past 30 years, transport emissions have risen faster than those of any other sector, and developing
      countries like Nigeria are experiencing rapid increases.
    </p>

    <h3 class="pmx-subtitle">The Price Marketplace Contribution</h3>
    <ol class="pmx-list">
        <li>
          Information Instrument –
          By checking food prices online, consumers can <em>decide when and where to shop</em>.
          This prevents unnecessary trips, cutting down on transport fuel use and emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technology Instrument (Future Updates) –
          <em>Shortest Routes</em> will direct users to the nearest or cheapest markets with real-time traffic updates, helping
          avoid congestion and minimizing time and emissions in transit.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="pmx-muted">Together, these tools encourage smarter shopping decisions that also contribute to climate sustainability.</p>

  <!-- 04. GUARANTEEING PRICE ACCURACY -->
  <article class="pmx-section">
    <h2 class="pmx-title">04. Guaranteeing Price Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      Since the platform depends on user input, accuracy is ensured through scale and validation:
    </p>
      <ul class="pmx-list">
        <li>The majority of users will provide genuine prices because it benefits them.</li>
        <li>False data, if entered, will be outweighed by the volume of accurate entries, shifting averages toward the real market price.</li>
        <li>Community reporting tools and data validation systems will further strengthen accuracy.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="pmx-muted">
      This ensures that the average price displayed for each item reflects reality and remains reliable for consumers,
      merchants, and governments.
