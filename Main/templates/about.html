    <h1 class="pmx-title">01. INTRODUCTION – Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Price Marketplace</strong> is a digital platform designed to reduce the wide and frustrating price
      variations across food markets in Nigeria.
    </p>
    <ul class="pmx-list">
      <li><strong>Merchants</strong> can log in daily to update the prices of their food items.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumers</strong> can access the platform to see up-to-date prices and make better shopping decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Government agencies and research bodies</strong> can use the aggregated price data for monitoring, regulation, and policy development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pmx-muted">
      By promoting price transparency, the platform helps consumers save money, gives merchants visibility, and enables
      policymakers to work with reliable food price data.

  <article class="pmx-section">
    <h2 class="pmx-title">03. BEYOND PRICES – Reducing Carbon Emissions</h2>

    <h3 class="pmx-subtitle">Background</h3>
    <p>
      Transportation is a leading source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide.
      <strong>Carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong> accounts for the largest share.
      <strong>Road transport</strong> contributes roughly <strong>76%</strong> of transport emissions.
      Over the past 30 years, transport emissions have risen faster than those of any other sector, and developing
      countries like Nigeria are experiencing rapid increases.
    </p>

    <h3 class="pmx-subtitle">The Price Marketplace Contribution</h3>
    <ol class="pmx-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Information Instrument</strong> –
        By checking food prices online, consumers can <em>decide when and where to shop</em>.
        This prevents unnecessary trips, cutting down on transport fuel use and emissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Technology Instrument (Future Updates)</strong> –
        <em>Shortest Routes</em> will direct users to the nearest or cheapest markets with real-time traffic updates, helping
        avoid congestion and minimizing time and emissions in transit.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="pmx-muted">Together, these tools encourage smarter shopping decisions that also contribute to climate sustainability.</p>

  <!-- 04. GUARANTEEING PRICE ACCURACY -->
  <article class="pmx-section">
    <h2 class="pmx-title">04. GUARANTEEING PRICE ACCURACY</h2>
    <p>
      Since the platform depends on user input, accuracy is ensured through scale and validation:
    </p>
    <ul class="pmx-list">
      <li>The <strong>majority of users</strong> will provide genuine prices because it benefits them.</li>
      <li><strong>False data</strong>, if entered, will be outweighed by the volume of accurate entries, shifting averages toward the real market price.</li>
      <li><strong>Community reporting tools</strong> and <strong>data validation systems</strong> will further strengthen accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pmx-muted">
      This ensures that the average price displayed for each item reflects reality and remains reliable for consumers,
      merchants, and governments.
