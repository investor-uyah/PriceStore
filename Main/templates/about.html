  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 mb-3">Introduction: Project Overview</h4>
  <p class="ms-3 text-muted">
    The Price Marketplace aims to reduce the frustrating price variations across food markets in Nigeria. 
    Merchants will log in to update the prices of their food items daily, while consumers will log in to see 
    these updates in real time. Governments and research bodies will also gain access to food price data 
    for better decision-making.
  </p>

  <!-- MORE DETAILS -->
  <h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 mb-3">More Details</h4>
  <p class="ms-3 text-muted">
    The Price Marketplace is designed as a platform where consumers and merchants can upload the 
    prices at which they buy and sell foodstuffs in their area or region. The core idea is to reduce 
    widespread price discrepancies in Nigeriaâ€™s foodstuff markets.  
  </p>
  <p class="ms-3 text-muted">
    By using the platform, users will be able to identify stores and markets with lower foodstuff prices, 
    saving money while gaining insights into food availability. Over time, the platform will also introduce 
    additional planned features such as:
  </p>
  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li class="text-muted">Best Time to Shop: Recommendations on when to shop specific foodstuffs at the lowest prices.</li>
    <li class="text-muted">Shortest Routes: Navigation to the nearest/cheapest market with real-time traffic updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- BEYOND PRICES -->
  <h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 mb-3">Beyond Prices: Reducing Carbon Emissions</h4>
  <p class="ms-3 text-muted">
    The Price Marketplace supports sustainable transportation by helping users make informed shopping 
    decisions. This reduces unnecessary trips and associated transport-related emissions.  
  </p>
  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li class="text-muted">Information Instrument: Users can access updated commodity prices, helping them decide when 
      and where to shop. This prevents unnecessary shopping trips and the emissions they generate.</li>
    <li class="text-muted">Technology Instrument: With planned navigation features, users will be able to find the shortest 
      and most efficient routes to markets, reducing travel time and lowering transport-related carbon emissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- GUARANTEE PRICE ACCURACY -->
  <h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 mb-3">Guaranteeing Price Accuracy</h4>
  <p class="ms-3 text-muted">
    The platform is user-driven. While some individuals may provide false information, the majority of users 
    will share accurate prices. The collective volume of reliable data will naturally outweigh outliers, ensuring 
    that the average displayed price of a food item is trustworthy.
