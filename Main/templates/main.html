    <p>Hello <strong>{{ user.username }}</strong>, you are logged-in! ðŸ™‚</p> 

    <p>Own a foodstuff shop, minimart, or anything of that nature? If yes, then this is just the right place for you. The Price Store offers you a platform to showcase the low, competitive prices of your edible goods. 
    At a time when foodstuff prices are largely unregulated, you can stand out and help achieve market stability by updating prices daily on the Price Store. <br>
    You can also participate as a customer by providing prices of foodstuffs based on purchases you've made in your locality. 
    <p>
