## About the Price Marketplace

The Price Marketplace will be a platform where consumers and merchants can upload the prices at which they purchase and sell specific foodstuffs in their area or region. The main idea is to reduce price discrepancies that are widely affecting Nigeria’s foodstuff market. Also, stores/markets with lower foodstuffs prices will be identifiable, saving consumers money.

Future releases of the Price Marketplace will utilize price and location data inputted by users (merchant/consumer) to deliver suggestions on the “best time to shop specific foodstuffs”, “shortest routes to the cheapest stores/markets”, and so on.

This will help reduce carbon emission/energy consumption since users will only go shopping when their desired foodstuffs are available at a market, and when the price is affordable by them. In addition, they’ll be able to see the shortest routes available, cutting down transportation time.

Governments at different levels will be able to use the platform to gain understanding of foodstuff availability and prices.
